    <p>This is our special dish of Lebanese Mountain Bread</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour (or a mix of flours like whole wheat and white)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Yeast (or sometimes baking powder, depending on the variation)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Olive oil (optional, for softness and flavor)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps for preparations</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Mix the Dough</b></li>
        <p>Combine flour, water, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Mix until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms.</p>
        <li><b>Knead and Rest</b></li>
        <p>Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover and let it rest for 1 &ndash; 2 hours until it doubles in size.</p>
        <li><b>Divide and Shape</b></li>
        <p>Divide the dough into small balls. Roll each one into a thin circle—almost paper-thin—using a rolling pin or by hand.</p>
        <li><b>Preheat the Saj or Griddle</b></li>
        <p>Heat a domed saj (or an upside-down wok or hot griddle) until very hot. No oil is needed.</p>
        <li><b>Cook the Bread</b></li>
        <p>Place the thin dough circle on the hot surface. Cook for about 30 &ndash; 60 seconds per side until it bubbles and lightly browns. Flip once.</p>
    </ol>
